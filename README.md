# 🏁 SQL for Data Analysis — Kaggle Course Completion

This repository contains my notes, code, and learnings from the **"Intro to SQL"** course on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-sql). The course provides a strong foundation in using **SQL with Google BigQuery** for exploring and analyzing large datasets.

---

## ✅ Course Completion

I have successfully completed all six lessons in the course, including both tutorials and exercises:

---

## 📘 What I Learned

- Writing basic SQL queries using `SELECT`, `FROM`, and `WHERE`
- Aggregating data using `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and `COUNT`
- Sorting results with `ORDER BY`
- Structuring complex queries using Common Table Expressions (`WITH`)
- Joining multiple tables using `JOIN`
- Querying large datasets using **BigQuery** efficiently

---

## 📌 Next Steps

Now that I’ve completed this course, I plan to:
- Explore more advanced SQL topics (window functions, subqueries, optimization)
- Apply SQL to real-world datasets for exploratory analysis
- Combine SQL with Python in data science workflows
